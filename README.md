# ⚡ KiCAD & Engineering Development Portfolio

Welcome to my project repository! This space serves as a portfolio of my technical coursework in PCB design using KiCAD, as well as my ongoing professional development and career planning.

## 🛠️ Technical Projects & Hardware Design

This section contains my hands-on engineering work, focusing on circuit design, schematic capture, and PCB layout.

* **Astable Multivibrator Project**
  * `Astable_Multivibrator_Assignment_Report.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the theory, design process, and simulation results of an astable multivibrator circuit.
  * `schematic_merged.pdf`: The finalized, merged schematic diagrams for the multivibrator and related circuit designs.
* **Mastering KiCAD Coursework**
  * `HOL-Mastering KiCAD-V1_lesson 1 1.pdf`: Hands-on learning notes and assignments covering the fundamentals of the KiCAD interface and basic schematic capture.
  * `HOL-Mastering KiCAD-V1_lesson 2 1.pdf`: Advanced lessons focusing on footprint assignment, PCB layout routing, and design rule checks (DRC).

## 📈 Professional Development (RPIE)

Alongside technical hardware skills, I am actively tracking my professional growth and workplace readiness through the following schedules:

* `RPIE_Technical_Foundations_Schedule.csv`: Core engineering concepts and foundational skill-building timeline.
* `RPIE_Advanced_Technical_Schedule.csv`: Planning for advanced technical coursework and specialized skills.
* `RPIE_Workplace_Success_Schedule.csv`: Milestones for developing soft skills, communication, and workplace effectiveness.
* `RPIE_Career_Planning_Schedule.csv`: Long-term goals, networking milestones, and career trajectory mapping.

## 🗂️ Other Documents
* `Document (4).pdf`: [Note: Replace this with a brief description of the document once renamed, e.g., Reference datasheet or project rubric.]
