# ⚡ KiCAD Development Portfolio

Welcome to my project repository! This space serves as a portfolio of my technical coursework in PCB design using KiCAD.
## 🛠️ Technical Projects & Hardware Design

This section contains my hands-on engineering work, focusing on circuit design, schematic capture, and PCB layout.

* **Astable Multivibrator Project**
  * `Astable_Multivibrator_Assignment_Report.pdf`: A comprehensive report detailing the theory, design process, and simulation results of an astable multivibrator circuit.
  * `schematic_merged.pdf`: The finalized, merged schematic diagrams for the multivibrator and related circuit designs.
* **Mastering KiCAD Coursework**
  * `HOL-Mastering KiCAD-V1_lesson 1 1.pdf`: Hands-on learning notes and assignments covering the fundamentals of the KiCAD interface and basic schematic capture.
  * `HOL-Mastering KiCAD-V1_lesson 2 1.pdf`: Advanced lessons focusing on footprint assignment, PCB layout routing, and design rule checks (DRC).
